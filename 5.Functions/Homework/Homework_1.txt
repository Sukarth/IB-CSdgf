1. 
    a. The first benefit of functions is that when maintaining code, a change only needs to be made in one place. 
    In larger projects, this is particularly useful as changing the same thing in several parts of a project is laborious. 

    b. Similarly, the code is easier to debug. Since you only have to make all changes in one place, you prevent errors throughout the program.

    c. Time is saved; you do not need to write the same thing again with a different use-case. You can just revamp the original one to allow for more flexibility.

2. 
    The signature of a function refers to its name, its parameters (incl. names, number, order and various additional properties).

3.
