Why is the following statement true?

Array element access and array element modifcation both have worst-case time complexity O(1).

Answer: 

Python stores lists as a contiguous block of memory. Thus, it is possible to merely access one element and change it without going through all previous elements.

When using linked-lists, you need to go through all of them, but this model also enables insertions and deletions to be more efficient.
